# LibriRecapture

We noticed that a lot of people are using their mobile devices to recapture the sound from TV, radio, etc.  This kind of behavior introduces distortions from replay and recapture devices,  reverberations, and background noises, which degrade the performance of the ASR systems.  We use LibriSpeech as our replay audio and recapture audio using mobile devices. 891 hours of audio were successfully replayed and 1892 hours were recaptured and this is the first large audio corpus focusing on recapture audio speech recognition. We provide a simple way to recapture audio on a large scale.  Experimental results show that using recapture data as training data improves the robustness of the ASR systems in recapture scenario.
